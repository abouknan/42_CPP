I'll create a tracked TODO list for the project plan (so we can mark the scaffold task as in-progress and keep progress visible). Expected outcome: a persistent todo list with the scaffold step set to in-progress and all other items not-started.

Created 13 todos

Progress update — TODO list created and the scaffold task is marked in-progress.

Next steps I recommend (please confirm the following choices so I can start scaffolding immediately):

Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (recommended). OK?
DB/ORM: Prisma with SQLite for local dev, Postgres in production. OK?
Payments: Defer payments to next milestone (I’ll add a Stripe stub/webhook). Do you want to enable payments in MVP or defer?
Languages: Start with English + French (add Arabic later). OK?
Accounts & Admin: Include basic admin UI and optional user accounts (guest bookings allowed). OK?
Mobile: Mobile-first responsive design — yes.
If you confirm these (or give alternate choices, e.g., prefer plain JS instead of TypeScript, or want payments now), I’ll:

Scaffold the Next.js project with TypeScript + Tailwind + Prisma (SQLite).
Add initial models (User, Vehicle, Route, Schedule, Booking) to Prisma schema.
Implement a simple GET /api/routes and POST /api/bookings endpoint and the minimal frontend search -> results -> booking pages.
Show exact commands to run locally and commit the initial scaffold.
Which choices do you confirm (or change)? Once you confirm, I’ll scaffold the project and continue — I’ll keep the todo list updated as I progress and run quick tests after scaffold to verify everything works.

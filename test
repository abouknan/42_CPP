Good — I sketched a practical plan to start the booking site and put it in a TODO list so we can track progress.

High-level proposal (what I'd build)

Purpose: A tourist transport booking site focused on Agadir and Morocco — search routes, choose vehicle/seat, book & pay, get confirmations, admin manages vehicles/schedules.
MVP features:
City/route search and list of available transports (date/time, vehicle type, seats left, price)
Booking flow: select seats (or passenger count), collect contact/payment info, confirmation page + email
Admin UI: add/edit vehicles, routes, schedules, view bookings
Basic user accounts (optional): view/cancel bookings
Map view for routes (optional) and localization (French + Arabic + English)
Core entities (sketch):
User {id, name, email, phone, role}
Vehicle {id, type, capacity, plate, features}
Route {id, origin, destination, waypoints?, distance}
Schedule {id, route_id, vehicle_id, datetime, seats_total, seats_booked, price}
Booking {id, schedule_id, user_info, seats, total_price, status, payment_id}
API endpoints (REST examples):
GET /routes?from=Agadir&to=Marrakech&date=...
GET /schedules/:id
POST /bookings
GET /admin/bookings
POST /webhook/payment (Stripe)
Tech stack recommendations (pick one):
Modern fullstack (recommended): Next.js (React) for frontend + API routes, PostgreSQL (managed), Vercel deployment. Benefits: SSR for SEO, single repo, easy deploy.
Alternative backend-first: React + Express/Nest + PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean/Heroku.
Maps: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap or Mapbox (paid), Geocoding via Mapbox/Google Maps.
Payments: Stripe (recommended) or PayPal.
Emails: SendGrid or Mailgun.
Auth: NextAuth.js (if using Next.js) or JWT.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for fast UI.
Non-functional requirements & constraints:
GDPR and data privacy (collect minimal PII, add privacy policy)
Locale support (fr/ar/en)
Secure payments and HTTPS, sanitized inputs, rate limits
High availability for booking operations (avoid double-booking with DB transactions/row locking)
Immediate next steps (I can do these now)

Confirm scope & priorities: user roles, must-have cities/routes, payment required, and whether you want admin and accounts.
If you want, I'll scaffold a Next.js project with:
Tailwind CSS, TypeScript (optional), Prisma + SQLite (dev) or Postgres, basic API endpoints and minimal booking flow.
Or I can create a smaller static prototype (Figma-like wireframe + HTML/CSS) to validate UX first.
Permissions / decisions I need from you

Which stack do you prefer? (Next.js recommended)
Do you want payments in MVP or deferred to later?
Languages to support initially (French, Arabic, English?)
Mobile-first responsive layout required? (Yes recommended)
If you want me to start right away, pick one of:

Scaffold Next.js + API + DB (I will create the repo structure, basic models, and a simple search + booking API).
Build a clickable UI prototype (HTML/CSS or Figma-style).
Start backend-only (DB schema + REST API + admin CLI).
Which of the three should I start with? If you pick 1, I’ll create the project skeleton and implement the first endpoints (routes/schedules search + booking POST) and show how to run it locally.
